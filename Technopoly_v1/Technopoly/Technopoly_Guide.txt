	•	When a player has three software developers working at each start-up in a complete field he/she may hire a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and employ them in any start-up of that field. 
	•	Only one CTO can work at any one start-up. 


Takeover Start-up [Use Case 12]
	•	If a player wishes to purchase a start-up from another player, they may attempt a takeover by making a request to the owner of the start-up.
